# Specialty_Coffee_Case_Study

In this case study, I'll be taking on the role of the lead data scientist for our up-and-coming specialty coffee company. My mission is to leverage customer data to make crucial business decisions. I'll be using scikit-learn to construct four distinct decision tree models, two based on entropy and two on Gini impurity. The goal is to determine whether a potentially game-changing partnership with a mysterious coffee farm in China can propel our business to new heights.

Throughout this case study, I'll be following the full data science pipeline. This includes tasks such as data importing, loading, and cleaning, all the way to model building and drawing conclusions. My decision trees will implement the supervised learning method of classification, and I'll adhere to best practices, including:

Making an appropriate train/test split.
Implementing one-hot encoding.
Evaluating the models.
Setting maximum tree depth to avoid overfitting.
Leveraging random forests to enhance predictive accuracy and manage overfitting.
Let's dive into this exciting journey of data-driven decision-making!
